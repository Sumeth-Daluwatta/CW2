%% TASK 4 - REFLECTIVE STATEMENT [5 MARKS]

%During this Coursework I felt I was very strong in my coding ability.
%Ibelieve this was very strongly reflected in my ability to answer the
%preliminary, first and second question where I was able to quicklyfindany
%problems with my code and fix them accordingly. However, I felt that in
%Q3, I was struggling a lot to find the rate ofchange of temperature.
%However, after some time and researching I finally got my code to work.
%I found connecting the arduini more complicated than writing the code for
%the most part. I spent quite a while on task 1 trying to connect the
%arduino properly so I didn't have very high temperature. Furthermore, in
%task 2, I found it diffult to connect it to the LED's and therminstor
%withour running out of jumper cables. Netherless, after quite a bit of
%research I found a way to put them together for them to finally work. 
% Since I had to do some research to find what to do, it also helped me
% runmy code better.
%My code mostly has afew parts that repeat that repeats very often 
% (a = arduinio, find the voltage,calcualting the temperature), so if
%I had a specific part that could run that instead of writing that out in
%every individual piece it would help save some time.
